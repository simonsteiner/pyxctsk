"""
Comprehensive SSS (Start Speed Section) tests for pyxctsk.

This module consolidates all SSS-related test coverage, including:
- Core SSS calculation algorithms and entry point logic
- Route optimization and bug validation for SSS tasks
- Visual verification and output for SSS routing
- Structure and integration checks for SSS tasks

All essential SSS test functionality is maintained in this single module.
