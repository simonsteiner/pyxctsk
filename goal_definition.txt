Goal definition
one of "CYLINDER"/"LINE", optional (default CYLINDER)

The last turnpoint is always goal. If the last turnpoint is marked ESS than it is identical to goal and shares his line/cylinder settings. Otherwise ESS is always cylinder.
goal.type - line. In the case of line, the radius of the turnpoint corresponds to the 1/2 of the total length of the goal line. Ground orientation of the line is always perpendicular to the azimuth to the center of last turnpoint.

FAI Sporting Code, Section 7F XC scoring – 1st May 2020

6.2.2 Definition of goal 
A goal can be 
• A turnpointcylinder or 
• A goal line, defined by:
A centre point c, given as WGS84 coordinates
A length l, given in meters 
A previous point p, given as WGS84 coordinates 

6.2.2.1 Goal line 
The goal linecontrol zone consists of the semi-circle with radius l/2 behind the goal line, when coming from the 
last turn point that is different from the goal line centre. Entering that zone without prior crossing of the goal line 
is equivalent to crossing the goal line. 
Physical lines can be used in addition to the official, virtual goal line as defined by WGS84 coordinates, to increase 
attractiveness for spectators and media, and to increase visibility for pilots. Physical lines must be at least 50m 
long and 1m wide, made of white material and securely attached to the ground. The physical line must match as 
closely as possible the corresponding virtual line as defined by the goal GPS coordinates and the direction of the 
last task leg. It must not be laid out further from the previous turn point than the goal GPS coordinates. 
By default, the goal line length l is set to 400m.
